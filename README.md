## Schematics

## Camera preview support

Key process of setup camera preview extract from example [Android Camera2 Example][AndroidCamera2].

In order to support camera preview, you should enable hardware acceleration for your `Activity` or `Application`. More information about hardware acceleration, please refer to [Android Things Realse Notes][AndroidThingsRleaseNotes] and [Android Hardware Acceleration][HardwareAcceleration].

Take still picture while preview is on-going will close the preview capture session first and renew a preview capture session after picture is taken. This is because `V4L2 only supports 1 stream configuration at a time`, so we can not pass more than one `Surface` like `ImageReader.getSurface()` when we call `CameraDevice.createCaptureSession(...)`.

## Capture still picutre support

Key process of capture still picture extract from example [Doorbell][Doorbell].

## Details

We have two buttons for difference purpose.

In `MainActivity`:

- Button A: start `TakePictureActivity`
- Button B: start `CameraPreviewActivity`

In `TakePictureActivity`:

- Button A: trigger take still picture
- Button B: return to `MainActivity`

In `CameraPreviewActivity`:

- Button A: trigger take still picture while preview is on-going
